    "    <p>Learn what an API is and when you should use one.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Learn how to build a web API that returns data to its users.</p>\n",
    "    <h3>What is an API?</h3>\n",
    "    <p>In programming more generally, the term API, short for Application Programming Interface, refers to a part of a computer program designed to be used or manipulated by another program.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Computer programs frequently need to communicate amongst themselves or with the underlying operating system, and APIs are one way they do it.</p>\n",
    "    <p>A web API allows for information or functionality to be manipulated by other programs via the internet.</p>\n",
    "    <p>For example, with Twitter’s web API, you can write a program in a language like Python or Javascript that can perform tasks such as favoriting tweets or collecting tweet metadata.</p>\n",
    "    <h3>When to Create an API</h3>\n",
    "    <p>In general, consider an API if:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>Your data set is large, making download via FTP unwieldy or resource-intensive.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>Your users will need to access your data in real time, such as for display on another website or as part of an application.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>Your data changes or is updated frequently.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>Your users only need access to a part of the data at any one time.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>Your users will need to perform actions other than retrieve data, such as contributing, updating, or deleting data.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h3>API Terminology</h3>\n",
    "    <p>When using or building APIs, you will encounter these terms frequently:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the primary means of communicating data on the web. HTTP implements a number of “methods,” which tell which direction data is moving and what should happen to it. The two most common are GET, which pulls data from a server, and POST, which pushes new data to a server.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) - An address for a resource on the web, such as <a href=\"https://programminghistorian.org/about?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_source=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_content=000026UJ&#x26;utm_term=10006555&#x26;utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDA0321ENSkillsNetwork21426264-2022-01-01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">https://programminghistorian.org/about</a>. A URL consists of a protocol (http://), domain (programminghistorian.org), and optional path (/about). A URL describes the location of a specific resource, such as a web page. When reading about APIs, you may see the terms URL, request, URI, or endpoint used to describe adjacent ideas.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based data storage format that is designed to be easy to read for both humans and machines. JSON is generally the most common format for returning data through an API, XML being the second most common.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    <h3>Implementation of web API using Flask</h3>\n",
    "    <p><a href=\"https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_source=Exinfluencer&#x26;utm_content=000026UJ&#x26;utm_term=10006555&#x26;utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDA0321ENSkillsNetwork21426264-2022-01-01\">Flask</a> is a web framework for Python, meaning that it provides functionality for building web applications, including managing HTTP requests and rendering templates</p>\n",
    "    <p>Flask maps HTTP requests to Python functions.</p>\n",
    "    <p>Let us understand this with a small example</p>\n",

    "    <p>In this case, we’ve mapped one URL path (‘/’) to one function, <strong>home</strong>. When we connect to the Flask server at <a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:5000/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a>, Flask checks if there is a match between the path provided and a defined function. Since /, or no additional provided path, has been mapped to the home function, Flask runs the code in the function and displays the returned result in the browser.</p>\n",
    "    <p>In this case, the returned result is HTML markup for a home page welcoming visitors to the site hosting our API.</p>\n",

    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>app.config[\"DEBUG\"] = True — Starts the debugger. With this line, if your code is malformed, you’ll see an error when you visit your app. Otherwise you’ll only see a generic message such as Bad Gateway in the browser when there’s a problem with your code.</p>\n",
    "      </li>\n",
    "      <li>\n",
    "        <p>app.run() — A method that runs the application server.</p>\n",

    "    <h2>Creating the API</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Now that we have a running Flask application and know a little about what Flask does, we’re finally ready to implement a small API with data that we’ll define right in our application.</p>\n",
    "    <p>We’ll be adding our data as a list of Python dictionaries. Dictionaries in Python group pairs of keys and values, like this:</p>\n",
